## Intent : Integrate JDK6 Service Loader in Sprint Boot app

<p>A spring boot application to demonstrate working of JDK 6 ServiceLoader (java.util) in the same application. There are several projects to demonstrate 
similar concept. But here the idea was to check and confirm the service provider implementation could be part of the same application jar.</p>
Lot of source code has been reused from original java documentation on Oracle [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html)
